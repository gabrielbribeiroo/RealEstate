## Scenarios and Calculations

The application compares the following scenarios:

### 1. Money Invested

Calculates the future value of an initial investment based on an annual return rate over a specified period.

**Inputs:**
- Initial Amount
- Annual Return Rate (%)
- Period (years)

### 2. Renovate to Live

Analyzes the costs and benefits of renovating an already-owned apartment to live in. The property value is considered for future appreciation but not as an initial cost.

**Inputs:**
- Property Value
- Renovation Cost
- Monthly Condo Fee
- Annual IPTU
- Annual Maintenance Cost
- Annual Property Appreciation (%)
- Period (years)

**Calculations:**
- **Total Initial Cost:** Renovation Cost
- **Annual Costs:** (Monthly Condo Fee * 12) + Annual IPTU + Annual Maintenance Cost
- **Total Costs:** Total Initial Cost + (Annual Costs * Period)
- **Future Property Value:** Property Value * (1 + Annual Property Appreciation)^Period
- **Net Return:** Future Property Value - Total Costs

### 3. Renovate to Rent

Evaluates the financial return of renovating an already-owned apartment and renting it out. Similar to 'Renovate to Live', property value is not an initial cost.

**Inputs:**
- Property Value
- Renovation Cost
- Monthly Condo Fee
- Annual IPTU
- Annual Maintenance Cost
- Monthly Rent Income
- Annual Property Appreciation (%)
- Period (years)

**Calculations:**
- **Total Initial Cost:** Renovation Cost
- **Annual Costs:** (Monthly Condo Fee * 12) + Annual IPTU + Annual Maintenance Cost
- **Total Rent Income:** Monthly Rent Income * 12 * Period
- **Total Costs:** Total Initial Cost + (Annual Costs * Period)
- **Future Property Value:** Property Value * (1 + Annual Property Appreciation)^Period
- **Net Return:** Future Property Value + Total Rent Income - Total Costs

### 4. Continue in Current Home

Assesses the financial implications of staying in the current home, including potential renovation costs and the opportunity cost of not renting it out.

**Inputs:**
- Current Home Value
- Annual IPTU
- Annual Maintenance Cost
- Renovation Cost (for current home)
- Annual Property Appreciation (%)
- Comparable Monthly Rent (what the home could be rented for)
- Period (years)

**Calculations:**
- **Annual Costs:** Annual IPTU + Annual Maintenance Cost
- **Total Costs:** (Annual Costs * Period) + Renovation Cost
- **Future Home Value:** Current Home Value * (1 + Annual Property Appreciation)^Period
- **Opportunity Cost:** Comparable Monthly Rent * 12 * Period
- **Net Return:** Future Home Value + Opportunity Cost - Total Costs
